  "translation": "(43) And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment,[372] [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, \"Praise to Allāh, who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allāh had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.\" And they will be called, \"This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do.\"",
  "footnotes": "[372]- i.e., ill will or sense of injury for what was inflicted upon them during worldly life."
